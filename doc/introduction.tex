\section{Introduction}
Ethos type notation (etn) is a programming-language-independent type system. It is used to type ipc and files. It serves as a bridge between the programming language and Ethos. Ethos types represent data only, they are not associated with the code for manipulating that data.
Each type in etn maps to a cryptographic hash which is one-for-one with types. Thus types can be defined independently, and two types have the same hash if, and only if, they are the same type.
