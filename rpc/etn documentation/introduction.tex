\section*{Introduction}
This paper describes the main data structures contained in the header file \emph{etn.h}. In particular, it focuses on \emph{Encoder} and \emph{Decoder} data structures and how they are related to data types.\\
Header \emph{etn.h} is part of \emph{libetn}, a C library for encoding, decoding, and verifying \textbf{ETN} types. The library's interface is built around readers and writers, which can be overloaded to encode/decode/verify memory buffers, file descriptors, etc.\\
Library \emph{libetn} interacts with code generated using \emph{eg2source}, that generates C code containing structures that describe types, and \emph{libetn} consumes these definitions to perform encoding/decoding/verifying.
