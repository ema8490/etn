\section*{Types}
\textbf{ETN} types are all defined in file \emph{types.h}.
As we can see, the encoders/decoders do not interact directly with the types. Indeed, the encoder/decoder type does not contain the type to be encoded/decoded. The interaction between them comes from other data structures that contain them all.\\
For instance, data structure \emph{EtnRpcHost} (defined in \emph{erpc.c} file and used for interprocess-communication):
\begin{lstlisting}
struct EtnRpcHost {
	EtnValue v;
	EtnEncoder *e;
	EtnDecoder *d;
};
\end{lstlisting}
