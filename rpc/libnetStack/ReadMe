libNetStack is integrated with etn, so this applies to both

Performance problems:
	    1. byte buffer (packet, etn)
	    2. byte-wide copies (memcpy)
	    3. unaligned accesses due to etn and ethernet headers
	    4. extra memcpys

Solution
	    1. packet and etn should code to uint32 buffers
	    2. don't use memcpy, use uint32/uint64 hybrid
	    3. offset ethernet headers
	    4. audit code for extra memcpy
