\section*{Introduction}

We give here a brief introduction on how the \emph{el} compiler is implemented so far what can be done to improve it.

Right now there isn't a proper Intermediate Representation (IR) code generation (it is like \emph{PyPy} before \emph{Just-in-Time} compiler was introduced). \emph{el} code is tokenized by a lexer (\emph{lexer.go}), parsed by Bison (\emph{parser.y}), and an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of the code is built; then, evaluating each node, the code is compiled. Each statement and operation is executed in \emph{go} (e.g. an \emph{el} sum becomes a sum in \emph{go} and then the result is returned). In such way the Abstract Syntax Tree itself is used as an high level IR.

This approach has the advantage of simplicity (the AST itself is the IR), but using an explicit IR (which is the "standard way" to build a compiler) turns into a simpler and more readable representation of the code.
